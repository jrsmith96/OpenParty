Open Party is a multi player hot seat game like Mario Party. Play with
up to 7 friends a nice open source board game with funny mini games.
It exists native support for gamepads or joysticks and a beta support
for dance pads. Overall you shouldn't play this game with keyboard,
especially agaist players with gamepads - you will lose. ;-)
